# airqualityES


These dataset contains daily quality air measurements in Spain over a period of 18 years (from 2001 to 2018). The measurements refer to several pollutants. These data are openly published by the Government of Spain.  The datasets were originally spread over a number of files and formats. Here, the same information is contained in simple dataframe for convenience of researches, journalists or general public. See the [Spanish Government website](https://www.miteco.gob.es/es/calidad-y-evaluacion-ambiental/temas/atmosfera-y-calidad-del-aire/calidad-del-aire/evaluacion-datos/datos/Default.aspx) for more information.
